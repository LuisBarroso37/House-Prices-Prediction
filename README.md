# House Prices Prediction

This project is my attempt at the Kaggle's House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques competition. The goal is to predict house prices given infromation about the houses and how much they were sold for.

The model that performed the best in this dataset was the Ridge Regression model and I managed to get a root mean squared error score of 0.12149 in my submission to Kaggle.
